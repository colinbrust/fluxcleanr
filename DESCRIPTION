Description: Countless academic papers use data from the FLUXNET2015 dataset to
  calibrate and validate their gross primary production and evapotranspiration 
  models. Unfortunately, there is no common framework for aggregating and
  cleaning these data, meaning methods across papers may be inconsistent. 
  This can be problematic when comparing results from two separate papers or
  models.This package cleans, gap fills and filters latent heat flux and GPP 
  data from the FLUXNET2015 dataset to provide a consistent framework for ET and
  GPP model calibration and validation.
